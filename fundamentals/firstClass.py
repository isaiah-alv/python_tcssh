#Variables
'''
If we have to store something we need a container or box to 
store this so, the variables are nothing but simple containers
to store data of different types.

RULES FOR NAMING!
- must start with a letter or the underscore character.
- cannot start with a number.
- only contain alphabet characters, numbers and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
- case-sensitive (name, Name, and NAME are three different variables).
